The app is built with the following technologies:

* HTML for structuring the content
* CSS for styling the content
* JavaScript for adding interactivity to the content
* Local storage for storing data

The app is easy to use and does not require any registration or login. The user can simply open the app and start using it.

The app is also fully open source and can be forked and modified to suit the user's needs.

The app is a great example of how to build a full-stack web app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
